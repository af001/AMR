# Amazing Race (AMR)

This application can be used for individuals, families, or teams who want to explore the Washington D.C. monuments located in the National Mall. Users should select the key points they wish to visit from the available list, and navigate to each site using a local guide map. Once the team makes it to a monument, the app has a series of questions about the sites. The team is responsible for exploring and learning about the monument so that they can figure out the answer.  

This project has been retired and is no longer available on the Google Play Store.
