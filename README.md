# Amazing Race (AMR)

This application can be used for individuals, families, or teams who want to explore the Washington D.C. sites around the National Mall. Users should select the key points they wish to visit from the available list, and navigate to each site using a local guide map. Once the team makes it to the site, the app asks the users a series of questions about the sites. The team is responsible for exploring and learning about the monument so that they can figure out the answer.
